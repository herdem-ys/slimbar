a simple js loader in style of youtube

I just created the animation in jQuery on pageload
Its not process based, so no background process like loading image or loading ressources, are in relation with the loader, its just the animation, and i set it up that when the DOM is not ready, a boolean variable is false, and while if this boolean variable is false, it will do the animation without any break.

It is up to how you integrate it within your project, have fun!

herdem-ys out.
